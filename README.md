# voronoi-grain-net

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper:  
**_Transfer learning approach with Voronoi-based synthetic data for high-accuracy segmentation of equiaxed grain boundaries_**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: About the Demo Page

**If you see this screen when accessing the demo, the app is NOT broken:**

<img src="sleep.png" alt="App sleep screen" width="500"/>

**This is normal!** The free hosting service puts the app to sleep when inactive.

### üîÑ How to wake it up:
1. **Click the blue button** that says **"Yes, get this app back up!"**
2. **Wait 30-60 seconds** for the app to start (first load is slow)
3. The app will then work normally

**The app is working, just sleeping. Please be patient!**


## Overview

This repository provides:

1. üß™ A **synthetic dataset generator** using Voronoi diagrams for microstructure-like segmentation tasks.
2. üß† Pretrained U-Net weights trained on synthetic Voronoi images, ready to be fine-tuned on SEM data.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è We do not provide a full training pipeline or U-Net implementation here. Please refer to [milesial/Pytorch-UNet](https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet) for the base architecture.

## Quick Start to Generate Voronoi Diagrams
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hosoda-tahara-org/voronoi-grain-net.git
   cd voronoi-grain-net
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Generate sample Voronoi image**
   ```bash
   python voronoi/main.py configs/sample_case_1.yaml 
   ```

üëâ For more configuration options, see [configs/README.md](configs/README.md).


## Using Pretrained Models

This section explains how to load and use the pretrained model weights with an existing U-Net implementation. **This repository does not provide a full U-Net training pipeline or inference script.** For the base U-Net architecture, please refer to [milesial/Pytorch-UNet](https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet).


1.  **Download Pretrained Models**  
   Download the pretrained model weights [from here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LeuwNjhs0DscPj5WA_630ilwzXm3i521?usp=sharing).

2. **Set up Pytorch-UNet**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet.git
   cd Pytorch-UNet
   # If necessary, install dependencies following the instructions in the Pytorch-UNet repository's README.
   ```

3. **Instantiate and Parameterize the U-Net Model**  
   In your own inference script, instantiate the U-Net model using the Pytorch-UNet codebase with the following parameters:

   ```python
   import torch
   from unet import UNet # Import the UNet class from Pytorch-UNet repository

   model = UNet(n_channels=1, n_classes=1, bilinear=False)
   ```

4. **Load the pretrained model**
   ```python
   # Replace 'path/to/pretrained/weights.pth' with the actual path to your downloaded weights file.
   model.load_state_dict(torch.load('path/to/pretrained/weights.pth'))
   ```
