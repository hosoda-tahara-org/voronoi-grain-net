## Overview

This repository provides:

1. üß™ A **synthetic dataset generator** using Voronoi diagrams for microstructure-like segmentation tasks.
2. üß† Pretrained U-Net weights trained on synthetic Voronoi images, ready to be fine-tuned on SEM data.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: We do not provide a full training pipeline or U-Net implementation here. Please refer to [milesial/Pytorch-UNet](https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet) for the base architecture.


## News

## Quick Start to Generate Voronoi Diagrams
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hosoda-tahara-org/voronoi-grain-net.git
   cd voronoi-grain-net
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Generate sample Voronoi image**
   ```bash
   python voronoi/main.py configs/sample_case_1.yaml 
   ```

üëâ For more configuration options, see [configs/README.md](configs/README.md).


## Using Pretrained Models

*Pretrained weights will be available soon*
