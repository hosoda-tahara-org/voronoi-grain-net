## Overview

Accurate segmentation of microstructural images is essential for quantitative materials characterization. However, traditional deep learning models often struggle due to limited annotated data and domain mismatch.

This project introduces a **transfer learning framework using synthetic Voronoi diagrams** to pretrain segmentation models. The approach is tailored for equiaxed grain boundary extraction in Œ±-phase pure titanium SEM images, and achieves **higher accuracy than ImageNet-based models**.

### Key Features

- **üîß Synthetic Data Generation**  
  Generate Voronoi diagrams with controllable parameters such as seed placement, grayscale variation, and noise.

- **üìà Improved Transfer Learning**  
  Pretraining on synthetic structures enhances generalization to real microstructures.

- **üìä High IoU Performance**  
  Outperforms ImageNet-pretrained models in grain boundary segmentation tasks.

- **üß† Feature Awareness**  
  Captures microstructure-relevant features like **triple junctions**, enabling segmentation even in low-contrast regions.
